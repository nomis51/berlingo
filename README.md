## Requirements

  the [release page](https://github.com/berlingo/berlingo/releases/latest) (where ``1.2.3` is the version number)
- Go to your browser
- Go to `Settings`
- Go to `Extensions`
- Go to `Manage extensions`
- Enable `Developer mode`
- Drag-n-drop the `berlingo.1.2.3.zip` file in the browser window
- The `Berlingo` extension should now appeared in the list of installed extensions and the extension's icon should now
  be visible in the browser taskbar
